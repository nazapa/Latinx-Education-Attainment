### LATINX EDUCATION ATTAINMENT BY GENDER (2012-2020)

### ACS1 - Latinx Education Attainment Rates in California, Texas, Florida, and New York States (2012-2020)
I used the ACS 1-year and ACS 5-year level data to determine the educational attainment rates of Latinx students between 2012 and 2020 in the following states: California, Texas, Florida, and New York. All of these states have seen an increase in the Latinx population since 2010. Therefore, I want to generate line graphs of the educational attainment rates of Latinxs in each state individually and then compare them against each other to analyze any patterns in the educational rates of each state.

In Figure \@ref(fig:temp-edu-attain1), we can see the Latinx Education Attainment Rates for California, Florida, New York, and Texas between 2012-2020. In these graphs we can see that among the four states, there is a higher percentage of Latinx students obtaining bachelor’s degrees or higher in Florida, followed by New York, Texas and California and in all states more Latina women are obtaining these degrees. Among the four states, California has the most Latinx students obtaining less than high school diplomas, with a higher percentage of Latino males obtaining these diplomas.

In Figure \@ref(fig:temp-edu-attain2), we can see the Latinx educational attainment rates for students in the  Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, California Metro Area between 2012-2020. In this line graph, we can see that there is an upward trend in the percentage of Latinx students obtaining bachelor’s degrees or higher degrees. When comparing Latina female and Latino male students, we can see that more Latina female students are earning bachelor’s degrees or higher than Latino male students. On the other hand, it seems that more Latino male students are earning high school diplomas in comparison to Latina female students.

In Figure \@ref(fig:temp-edu-attain3), we can see the Latinx Education Attainment Rates in New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metro Area between 2012-2020. We can see that there is a downward trend in the percentage of Latinx students who are obtaining less than a high school diploma. In terms of the attainment of bachelor’s degrees, there seems to be a drastic increase in these degrees after 2016 and from there it continues to increase. Also, Latina females obtained a higher percentage of bachelor degrees or higher in comparison to Latino males.

Again, it seems that Latina female students are earning more degrees than Latino male students.

In this line graph we can see that among all of the education rates, there was a spike in the percentage of Latinx high school graduates between 2016 and 2018. Also, there were more Latino males who graduated high school and earned a high school diploma than Latina women. After 2018, there was a decrease in the percentage of Latinx students who earned a high school diploma.

As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:temp-edu-attain7), we can see that there is an overall trend in all the counties, in which the percent of bachelor’s degrees attained were low for Latina female and Latino male students in comparison to the attainment of a high school diploma, less than a high school diploma, and some college or associate's degree.

In Figure \@ref(fig:temp-edu-attain8), we can see more closely the Latinx education attainment rates in the Los Angeles County, California. In this line graph, we can see that the educational attainment rates of Latinx remain low for the attainment of a bachelor’s degree or higher, followed by some college or associate’s degree, high school diploma, and less than a high school diploma. From this line graph, we can see that Latinx students in Los Angeles County, California between 2012-2020 have not earned many bachelor’s degrees or higher degrees and have earned less than a high school diploma. Still, it seems that between 2012-2020, there has been an upward trend in the number of Latinx students attaining bachelor’s degrees or higher degrees and the number of Latinx students attaining less than a high school diploma has been steadily decreasing.
